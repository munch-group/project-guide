# Introduction {.unnumbered}

These pages serve as a source of practial information to get you started. The part called "Project setup", take you though the steps to get you set up on your own machine and on our computing cluster. You should go through this part in the other it is listed and make sure you have succesfully completed each step before you go on. 

The Quickstarts are introductions to the most important tools you will use. 

You will end up producing a set of pages much like these, and the Notebooks and Reporting both serve as showcases and to give you an idea of how your own notebooks and reports will show once you get to that point.
