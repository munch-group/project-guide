# Introduction {.unnumbered}

These pages are generated from Git repository (more about that later). The repository serves both as a source of practial information to get you started, and as a scaffold for your project. Once you have copied it and made it your own, you populate with your own text, code, analysis notebooks, and documentation. For now most of what you see are placeholders for what will eventually be your own contributions.
